The reason why Java needs to be run with the java command is because the java
compiler 'javac' does not compile source code into machine code; however, it
converts source code into Bytecode which is then further compiled by the java
command. The java command runs a class loader, bytecode verifier and then JIT
Compiler in a JVM to finally produce machine code which is then run on the
machine to produce "Hello World". The C compiler compiles machine code therefore
it does not need to be further compiled and can be run by just entering the file
name.
