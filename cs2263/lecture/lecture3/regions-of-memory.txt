The four regions of memory include "Executable" which contains the content of the binary executable, this is located at the top of the process memory. The next region of memory is "Data" where the global and static variables are stored. Following that is the "Heap" which allows dynamic variables to request memory during run-time. The final region of memory is "Stack Memory" where local variables are stored. Stack Memory also contains a stack frame for each function call in which variables related to that function are stored.
