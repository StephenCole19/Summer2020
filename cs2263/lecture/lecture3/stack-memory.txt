Stack memory works by creating stack frames where variables created in each function are stored. As it is a stack the first stack frame is the last to be deallocated, this is why you can pass a value into "main(int example)" then call "printf("%d", example)" as many times as you want. The variable "example" is stored in a stack frame below the stack frames created for each function call and is therefore available to be used even after the "printf()" stack frames have been removed.
